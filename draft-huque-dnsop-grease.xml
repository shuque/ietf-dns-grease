        Long term evolvability of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol

      <t>
        Greasing was originally developed for the TLS protocol
        <xref target="RFC8701" />. Ongoing discussion of improving
        the technique as well as applying it more generally to other
        protocols continues in the IETF.

      <t>
        This document outlines considerations and proposals for
        applying grease to the
        <xref target="RFC1034" /><xref target="RFC1035" />
        Domain Name System (DNS).

      <name>Background</name>
      <t>
        Historically, DNS protocol evolution has encountered some
        significant deployment barriers. There are various reasons,
        including outdated systems, inertia, faulty implementations of
        DNS servers, middleboxes that have actively blocked the deployment
        of new protocol features, etc. Over time as some of these
        impediments have been uncovered and repaired, progress has
        been possible. However, a more systematic approach to ensure
        future progress is desirable.
      </t>
      <t>
        Remarkably, the Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS)
        specification,
        <xref target="RFC2671">originally published in 1999</xref>,
        is still not universally deployed, and often deployed
        incorrectly or incompletely. This eventually resulted in
        the exercise of a <xref target="FLAGDAY">DNS Flag Day effort</xref>
        to identity and eradicate implementations and network paths not
        compliant with the specification. Tools like ednscomp.isc.org
        have been testing this and other protocol defects in deployed
        infrastructure for many years. Even then, some level of incorrect
        behavior remains prevalent, necessitating probing and
        pre-arrangement of the use of some extension features like
        <xref target="RFC7871" />EDNS Client Subnet and
        <xref target="RFC7873" />DNS Cookies.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="opportunities" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Greasing Opportunities</name>
      <t>
        The DNS protocol has a number of protocol elements where the
        greasing of unallocated code points could be employed. Some of
        them are listed in the table below.
      </t>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Protocol Element</th><th>Size</th><th>Number of Values</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>DNS Header Flags</td><td>7-bits</td><td>7</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Resource Record Type</td><td>16-bits</td><td>65,536</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Opcode</td><td>4-bits</td><td>16</td></tr>
          <tr><td>EDNS Version</td><td>8-bits</td><td>256</td></tr>
          <tr><td>EDNS Header Flags</td><td>16-bits</td><td>16</td></tr>
          <tr><td>EDNS Opt Code</td><td>16-bits</td><td>65,536</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <t>
        The goals of periodically exercising the use of unallocated
        code points are to (1) discourage and prevent middleboxes and
        DNS implementations from hardcoding notions of what are the only
        allowable protocol parameter values, and (2) to prevent future
        extensibility failures by not causing them to malfunction
        in the presence of new values when they are defined.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that <xref target="RFC6891">EDNS</xref>
        options have a more complex structure involving both a code
        point and data. So greasing EDNS options would also require
        generating some random option data.
      </t>
      <t>
        Correctly implemented DNS servers will ignore these values and
        interoperate. Servers that do not tolerate unknown values will
        fail to interoperate and return an error (or may fail to respond).
        These failures could be logged and be used to identify broken
        implementations in the field that could be targeted for repair.
        DNS resolvers should retry such failed queries without the
        unallocated code point.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="reserving" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Randomized or Reserved code points</name>
      <t>
        DNS resolver implementations are proposed to periodically
        advertise unallocated code points at random in requests that
        they send out.
      </t>
      <t>
        They could select randomly from the unallocated
        range, but then would have to consider what happens when such
        code points are allocated in the future and whether they can
        deal with that situation gracefully. Alternatively, we could
        reserve a subset of the currently unused values for DNS
        resolver implementations to advertise at random. Some DNS
        protocol elements have only a small range of supported values,
        and may not be amenable to reserving a subset of that range.
      </t>

      <name>Reserved Code Point Values</name>

      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sampling" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Sampled Selection of Traffic</name>
      <t>
        To avoid the overhead of needing to retry many queries in the
        event of large scale intolerance of unallocated code points, only
        a sampled fraction of DNS requests emitted by a resolver should
        advertise unallocated code points. Many DNS resolvers are very
        high transaction rate systems, so only a small sample size of
        such DNS requests is sufficient to get a rough picture of
        non-compliant servers, perhaps 1 in 1000 requests? Furthermore,
        a community effort of aggregating and analysing the results of
        failed queries from many DNS resolver operators can provide an
        even more comprehensive view of the ecosystem.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="telemetry" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Telemetry and Results Evaluation</name>
      <t>
        DNS resolvers are expected to record the results of failures
        from the use of unallocated code points. This could be in a
        traditional log file, or a more complex centralized telemetry
        system. Additionally, the
        <xref target="ERROR-RPT">DNS Error Reporting</xref> mechanism
        could be employed to proactively notify operators that their
        authoritative DNS servers are deficient.
